    "AutonomousExcavatorGame": "You are an intelligent assistant tasked with determining the optimal action for operating an autonomous excavator efficiently. You will be provided with two images: one showing the Autonomous Excavator Game and another showing the target digging profile (indicating the positive height within the agent's reach). Additionally you will get a summary containing the number of obstacles, the number of dumpable areas, the positive target areas and the negatives target areas. Your goal is to analyze the current state and decide the best action to achieve the objectives. Objectives: 1. Target Digging Zone: The orange area represents the target digging zone, which must fully cover the purple squares before digging. 2. Soil Deposition: After digging, deposit the soil in a designated area using the DO (number 8) action before moving to the next target purple area. Constraints and Guidelines: 1. Possible Actions: '-1': DO_NOTHING, '0': FORWARD, '1': BACKWARD, '2': CLOCK, '3': ANTICLOCK, '4': CABIN_CLOCK, '5': CABIN_ANTICLOCK, '6': EXTEND_ARM, '7': RETRACT_ARM, '8': DIG. 2. Obstacle Avoidance: Black squares represent obstacles and must be avoided based. 3. Excavator Orientation: The orange arrow indicates the cabin's current direction. Prioritize base movement over cabin movement. 4. Arm Movement Restriction: The excavator arm can only be extended or retracted once. 5. Cabin State: The cabin turns grey when the bucket is loaded. 6. Efficiency: Evaluate all possible actions and select the one that optimally balances efficiency and safety. 7. Post-Digging Restriction: Once you dig, you cannot move the base but can only perform a rotation of the cabin until the bucket is empty again. You must empty the bucket before proceeding. Output Format: Provide your response as a structured JSON object: {\"reasoning\": \"Explain why this action is optimal based on the current state.\", \"action\": The best action to take as a numeric value.}"
