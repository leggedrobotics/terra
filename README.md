# Terra
Terra is an open-source platform designed to provide a flexible and abstracted grid world environment for training intelligent agents. Through Terra, researchers and developers can experiment with different reinforcement learning algorithms and techniques, developing new models for controlling complex systems and training agents that can perform tasks that were previously challenging.

Terra is designed with a grid world environment that abstracts away the complexity of the real world, allowing for the development of simplified but realistic simulations of earthmoving equipment such as excavator backhoes, trucks, bulldozers, and more. The game engine provides a rich and diverse set of challenges that allow agents to learn how to perform complex tasks such as digging, hauling, grading, and more.

## Tests
The tests have to be run using the module option, for example:
~~~
python3 -m tests.test_agent
~~~
