Analyze the current game frame and local map to determine the optimal next action.

- Each forward/backward move advances the excavator by 6 pixels.
- Excavator base is facing **{base_direction}**.
- Bucket status: **{bucket_status}**.
- Current location: **{current_pos}** (y, x).
- Target digging positions: **{target_pos_list}** (y, x).
- Previous actions: **{prev_actions}**.
- Suggested actions (NOT compulsory): **{suggested_actions}**.
- Remaining area to dig: **{dig_percentage}**.
#- You could generate and execute Python code to help you to dig correctly (for example for mathematical operations).

**DIGGING RULES**
- Align the bucket **directly facing the long edge** of the purple trench. This may require rotation and repositioning.
- You may **overlap the base with the purple trench** for proper alignment.
- Digging must start from the **furthest end** of the trench (relative to the excavator's front) and proceed **backward**.
  - Facing up → reach **topmost** trench point → dig downward
  - Facing down → reach **bottommost** → dig upward
  - Facing left → reach **leftmost** → dig rightward
  - Facing right → reach **rightmost** → dig leftward
- Ensure the **orange target area overlaps the purple trench** before digging.
- Purple turns **green** after successful excavation.

**MOVEMENT GUIDELINES**
- Avoid repeated forward/backward moves unless repositioning.
- Maintain **8–12 pixel distance** between the excavator and the trench for best alignment.
- If the bucket is empty, it’s okay to reposition and try digging again next.
- A common sequence: 6 (dig), rotate twice, 6 (deposit), rotate back, 1 (backward), 6 (dig), ...

- Do not dig twice (or more) in the same position. The sequence of action [..., 6, 6, ...] is NOT allowed

**RESTRICTIONS**
- Do not dig in areas that are:
  - Already dug
  - Not marked as negative in the target map
- Use the traversability mask (`0 = obstacle`, `1 = traversable`) to guide movement.
- Continue acting until **0%** of the trench remains undug.
